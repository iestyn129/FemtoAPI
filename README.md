# FemtoAPI
A super tiny and super simple HTTP server and API framework designed for only basic needs of me (iestyn129).

## Building
TynLog is written in Kotlin 2.2 on Java 8, and uses the IntelliJ IDEA build system.
This is what's most convenient for me, so don't complain about it.
Just be thankful the only other dependency works the same.

## Issues and Contribution
If you want to create issues or pull requests be my guest, but expect nothing from them. Yet again,
this is only for me.
