# FemtoAPI
A super tiny and super simple HTTP server and API framework designed for only basic needs of me (iestyn129).

## Building
TynLog is written in Kotlin 2.2.20 on Java 8, using Gradle 8.14.
I'm still new to Gradle, so don't expect perfection.

## Issues and Contribution
If you want to create issues or pull requests, be my guest but expect nothing from them.
Yet again, this is only for me.
